\chapter*{Declaration}
I know that plagiarism is wrong. Plagiarism is to use another's work and pretend that it is my own.

I have used the IEEE convention for citation and referencing. In this thesis, all contributions to, and quotations from, the work(s) of other people have been cited and referenced. 

This thesis is my own work. I have not allowed, and will not allow, anyone to copy my work.
