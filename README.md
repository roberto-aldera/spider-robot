# spider-robot 🕷️
⚠️ Messy research code 👨‍🎓

This repo contains the source code from my undergraduate mechatronics thesis project at the University of Cape Town.
An STM iNEMO was used for the data logging and control of a bio-inspired spider robot.
The majority of the development code is in C for use onboard the microcontroller, with some C# that was required for a logging app on my laptop.
