\chapter*{Abstract}
This thesis investigates aerial stabilisation of a bio-inspired jumping robot using a spider-like dragline. Previous work on pitch angle control by Shield \cite{StaceyThesis} (and others too) is expanded upon to include a mechanical leg for jumping as well as controller design for precision jumping. By using a position estimator, the platform's position can be established and treated as a control problem. A discussion on the use of the spider's dragline for precision jumping is presented and provides the basis for the problem formulation.
